Mitosis and meiosis are both types of cell division. Mitosis has 2 daughter cells that are identical to the parent cell. Meiosis is used for sexual reproduction and makes 4 unique haploid cells from one diploid cell. Every single organism goes through mitosis, but only organism that reproduce sexually go through meiosis.
