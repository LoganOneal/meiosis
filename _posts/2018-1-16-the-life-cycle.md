<p>
Sexual life cycles provide more genetic variation for the offspring. This is opposed to asexual cycles that essentially create clones of the parent. </p>

<p>Humans have 46 chromosomes, 23 from each parent. Gametes or sex cells provide the 23 chromosomes that when paired with a mate double to equal 46 total. Fertilization occurs by the sperm and egg combining to create a zygote.

<p>Diploid cells have identical copies of a persons 46 chromosomes. This is represented by 2n which means that they have 2 sets of chromosomes. The diploid cell then divides to create 4 haploid cells. These haploid cells have 23 chromosomes each and are reproductive cells called gametes. Gametes transmit genetic information during reproduction.</p>
