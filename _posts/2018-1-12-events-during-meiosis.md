Mitosis and meiosis are both types of cell division. Mitosis has 2 daughter cells that are identical to the parent cell. Meiosis is used for sexual reproduction and makes 4 unique haploid cells from one diploid cell. Every single organism goes through mitosis, but only organism that reproduce sexually go through meiosis. </p>

<h2>Meiosis I</h2>
<h3 id="heading3">Prophase I</h3>

<p>In this stage the chromosomes condense and will be visible inside the nucleus when viewed with a light microscope. The chromosomes were already duplicated during the S phase and now have two sister chromatids joined at the centromere. They have the shape of an "X" as seen in the picture below.</p>

<p>After the chromosomes have condensed the homologous chromosomes line up beside each other. The homologous chromosomes then trade DNA. This process is called crossing over. This helps to create more diversity in the organism.</p>

At the end of prophase I, the nuclear membrane finally begins to break down. Outside the nucleus, the spindle grows out from centrosomes on each side of the cell. As in mitosis, the microtubules of the spindle are responsible for moving and arranging the chromosomes during division.


<h3 id="heading3">Metaphase I</h3>

<p>During this stage the chromosomes line up in the center of the cell with each one having a random orientation. This gives the cell more diversity in in turn increases genetic diversity. </p>

<h3 id="heading3">Anaphase I</h3>

<p>During anaphase the meiotic spindle pulls the pairs of chromosomes apart. They are pulled toward the opposite poles of the cell.</p>

<h3 id="heading3">Telophase I</h3>

<p>The chromosomes finish moving to the opposite poles. A membrane then forms around the new bundles of chromosomes. This bundle is called the nuclei.</p>

<h2>Meiosis II</h2>

<p>The process of Meiosis is repeated through the stages prophase II, metaphase II, anaphase II, and telophase II. </p>

<h2>Simplified Version</h2>


<blockquote>
First Division<br>
Prophase 1: Duplicated chromatin condenses; Crossing over can occur during this stage.<br>
Metaphase 1: Homologous align at the equatorial plate <br>
Anaphase 1: Homologous pairs separate with daughter cells remaining together.<br>
Telophase 1: Two daughter cells are formed with each daughter cell containing one chromosome of the homologous pair.<br><br>
Second Division: Gametes Formation<br>
Prophase 2: DNA does nor replicate <br>
Metaphase 2:  Chromosomes align at the equatorial plate<br>
Anaphase 2: Centromeres divide and sister chromatids separate to each pole<br>
Telophase 2: The cell division is complete.  <br>
